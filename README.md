This exercise demonstrates your competency in the skills learned in this module. You must complete this exercise on your own, without any help from an instructor or another student. If you get stuck, go back through the relevant sections in the book, the quizzes, and the assignments for this module -- everything you need to do in this exercise has been covered in this module.

These are the skills you practiced in this module and will now demonstrate:

Input from and output to the console

Module 2 Competency Exercise: Movie Concession Stand

In a previous exercise, you wrote a program to calculate the cost for tickets at a movie theater. You've purchased those tickets and are on your way in to see the movie, but you stop at the concession stand first to get snacks: popcorn, boxes of candy, and drinks. Write a program in C++ that asks the user how many of each item they wish to purchase, calculates the price, asks the user how much they are paying, and determines the change.

Use the following prices:

Popcorn costs $5.00
Candy costs $3.50
Drinks cost $2.50

For example, if the user wants 1 popcorn, 1 candy, and 2 drinks, the total cost is $13.50 -- $5.00 for popcorn, $3.50 for candy, and (2 * $2.50) or $5.00 for drinks. The user pays with $20, so the change is $20 - $13.50 or $6.50. 

Validate that the user enters a money value for payment that is at least equal to the cost of the snacks. If not, provide an error message that they didn't pay enough money.

If the user doesn't purchase anything, display a message thanking them for stopping by. 

Example of program with no errors:                                Example of program with errors in amount of money paid

M2 Good Run     M2 Errors

Example of program with no purchase:

M2 no purchase

Take screenshots of the execution of the program, using 3 different sets of data, as shown here: one must show good data, one must show some errors in the amount paid, and one must be the scenario where the user does not purchase anything.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
